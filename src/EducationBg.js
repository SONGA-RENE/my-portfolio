      I began my educational journey at APEFE MWEYA, where I completed My
      primary school education from 2005 to 2011. Following that, I pursued my
      secondary education at Groupe scolaire Rambura Gar√ßons, where I completed
      my Ordinary Level studies. For my Advanced Level studies, I enrolled in
      the computer science program at Ecole Secondaire Technique de Gisenyi
      (ESTG). It was at ESTG that I obtained my A2 diploma, further expanding my
      knowledge and skills in the field of computer science.
      <br /> Continuing my educational pursuits, I then attended the University
      of Rwanda, specifically the College of Science and Technology, to pursue
      My bachelor's degree. My chosen field of study was IT (Information
      Technology), reflecting my interest in this area. After successfully
      completing my studies, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the University
      of Rwanda.
